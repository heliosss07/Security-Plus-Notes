## 1.2 Security Concepts

### CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality** – Ensures that data is only accessible to authorized users and entities.
    - Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
    - **Examples:** Encryption, access control lists (ACLs), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and data classification.
- **Integrity** – Ensures that data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered unless modified by authorized personnel.
    - Prevents unauthorized modification, deletion, or corruption of data.
    - **Examples:** Hashing, digital signatures, version control, checksums, and file permissions.
- **Availability** – Ensures that systems, data, and services are accessible to authorized users when needed.
    - Focuses on minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.
    - **Examples:** Redundant systems, backups, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery plans.

### Non-Repudiation

**Non-repudiation** is a core concept in cybersecurity that ensures an individual **cannot deny** having performed a particular action or transaction. 

- Hashing
- Digital Signature
- Private Key & Public Key

### **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**

The **AAA Framework** stands for **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**  a foundational model for managing user access, enforcing policies, and tracking user activity in a secure environment. It ensures that only the right people access the right resources, at the right times, for the right reasons.

- **Authentication** – Verifies *who you are.*
    - Confirms the identity of a user or device before granting access.
    - **Examples:** Passwords, PINs, **Certificate Authority**, digitally signed certificate on the device.
- **Authorization** – Determines *what you can do.*
    - Defines the permissions and access levels granted to an authenticated user.
    - **Examples:** Role-based access control (RBAC), file permissions, access control lists (ACLs).
- **Accounting (Auditing)** – Tracks *what you do.*
    - Records user activities for auditing, monitoring, and compliance purposes.
    - **Examples:** Log files, audit trails, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, RADIUS/TACACS+ logs.

### Gap Analysis

A **Gap Analysis** is a **security assessment process** used to identify the difference (or “gap”) between an organization’s **current security posture** and its **desired or required security state** (such as compliance with a policy, framework, or regulation).

**Example:**

If a company needs to comply with ISO 27001 but lacks an incident response plan, the gap analysis identifies that as a missing control that must be implemented.

### Zero Trust

**Zero Trust** is a modern **security framework and mindset** based on the idea that **no user, device, or network traffic should ever be trusted by default,** whether it originates inside or outside the organization’s network.

**Core principles of Zero Trust include:**

- **Verify explicitly:** Continuously authenticate and validate every access request using identity, device health, and location context.
- **Least privilege access:** Give users only the minimum permissions needed to perform their tasks.
- **Assume breach:** Design systems as if an attacker is already inside the network; segment and monitor accordingly.
- **Microsegmentation:** Divide the network into smaller zones so that even if one area is compromised, others remain secure.
- **Continuous monitoring:** Log and analyze all activities to detect abnormal behavior or potential threats.

**Example:**

Even if a user has already logged into the company’s VPN, Zero Trust still requires them to authenticate again when accessing sensitive databases or cloud apps.
