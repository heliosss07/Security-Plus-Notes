**Technical Change Management** refers to the **specific, hands-on implementation of change management within IT systems and infrastructure**

- **Version control:** Tracking updates to software, configurations, and code (e.g., using Git).
- **Configuration backups:** Ensuring systems can be restored if a change fails.
- **Testing environments:** Implementing changes in staging or sandbox environments first.
- **Rollback procedures:** Having recovery plans in case a change introduces errors.
- **Automation tools:** Using CI/CD pipelines, scripts, or configuration management tools (like Ansible or Puppet) to safely deploy updates.
- **Documentation and logging:** Recording what was changed, who made the change, and when.

**Example:**

Before applying a new firewall rule, the network team tests it in a lab, validates it through simulation, documents the results, and only then applies it to production with a backup ready in case it causes issues.
